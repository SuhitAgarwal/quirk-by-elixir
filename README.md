Quirk is a crossplatform, GPL-licensed, [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy)
app built in React Native / Expo.

Unlike many CBT apps, it's fairly unbiased in what you use it for; it doesn't ask about your mood or ask you
to do depression-specific CBT exercises. That makes it fairly quick and discreet to use, especially in a public
setting.

## Running Locally

Quirk is built on React Native and therefore assumes you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is preferred over NPM as a package manager.

```sh
# clone the project and cd into it
git clone git@github.com:Flaque/quirk.git; cd ./quirk

# install dependencies
yarn

# start development environment
yarn start
```

You'll then be in the [expo development environment](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/).
If you already have XCode installed with a simulator, you can just press `i` to start it.

# Design

Quirk's goal is to be both inviting and focused. It should be _really_ easy to enter in a thought; people frequently enter these in public settings and need to do it fairly quickly. It also should not cause any increased frustration.

## Design Logic

Quirk is built with two main goals in mind:

- Don't be bloated
- Don't be evil
